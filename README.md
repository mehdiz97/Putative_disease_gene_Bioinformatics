Our study employs a network-based approach to identify potential disease genes and repurposable drugs for ciliopathies, using algorithms like DIAMOnD, DiaBLE, and Diffusion-based methods. This report details our methodology, algorithmic comparisons, and the potential of our findings in the context of drug repurposing for ciliopathies, aiming to contribute to the development of effective treatments for these disorders.
